To run the game on your local machine, you will need to follow these steps:

## Gameplay

Once you start the game, you will see a grid of cards, each displaying a different animal. Click on any card to reveal the animal underneath. The goal is to remember which animal is under which card, and click on a different card that displays the same animal. Each time you click on a new animal, the cards will shuffle and you can continue playing.

If you click on the same animal twice, you will lose the game and have to start over from the beginning. The game has multiple levels, with more cards and animals added as you progress.
